So, no, it's not like this tree is going to do your Christmas shoppings anytime soon. But it does make for an interesting bright-colored ornament that will fit right into any room that needs intelligent lighting and a bright-colored ornament.

The frame of this Christmas tree comes from Ikea, a flat-packed metal thingy that extracts into a meter high spiral-shaped tree. Not that much to look at, but superb for mounting a string of WS2812B RGB leds. I'm sure likewise contraptions exist in all major shopping areas. I bought a 5 meter roll from BangGood of the type with 150 leds per 5 meter. There's also 300/5 meter available.
